## Factors Influencing Oxygen Supply During COVID-19 

#### *A deep dive into the 2021 Indian Oxygen Crisis*

This repo contains the code and the associated model cards for a manuscript examining the issue of acute Oxygen shortage during the 2021 COVID-19 wave in India. On April 22, 2021 India recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world, overwhelming the medical facilities and also revealing a formerly unknown oxygen crisis within the nation. Several hospitals lost patients due to shortage of medical grade oxygen for patients on ventilators and in critical care. The main goal of this report is to examine closely the data before and after the crisis and, attempt to create a predictive model to foresee such crisis in the future. We look at several variables influencing the oxygen availability as-well-as demand in the nation alongside tangential variables like the oxygen exports and imports of the nation. Our central goal is to highlight important variables that can lead to and possibly help avert such a crisis in the future in a data driven manner.

### Data Access

Our preliminary data comes from [DataMeet](https://projects.datameet.org/covid19/oxygen_shortage_deaths/) which contain ‌deaths‌ ‌due‌ ‌to‌ ‌the‌ ‌lack‌ ‌of oxygen, shortage of oxygen, or denial of ‌oxygen‌ ‌in‌ ‌hospitals‌ ‌during‌ ‌the‌ ‌second‌ ‌wave‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌Covid-19‌ ‌pandemic‌ ‌in‌ ‌India‌. The‌ ‌deaths‌ ‌recorded‌ ‌are‌ ‌based‌ ‌on‌ ‌reports‌ ‌from‌ ‌newspapers‌ ‌and‌ ‌news‌ ‌media‌ ‌in‌ ‌English‌ ‌and‌ ‌regional‌ ‌languages, social media, and‌ ‌networks‌ ‌of‌ ‌volunteers‌ ‌working‌ ‌on‌ ‌the‌ ‌ground.‌ ‌ Furthermore, another dataset we use is publicly available from the the R, [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) containing a daily summary of COVID-19 cases, deaths, recovered, tests, vaccinations, and hospitalizations for 230+ countries, 760+ regions, and 12000+ administrative divisions of lower level including policy measures, mobility, and geospatial data.
